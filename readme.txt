I have made a tables which uses backend to upload data for artists.
Data is stored in MongoDB, we can sort it accordingly and similarly 
we can create a table for songs playlist.
To be very honest, i dont have much experience with MERN or MEAN stack
so i was unable to add much functionality also i was unable to give it 
much of the time as my Dissertation work is going on and the submission 
date is near as my semester is going to end soon.
With practice and training i will be able to apply my skills in a better
way.
Thankyou, please consider.
